Discord Message 1 — Problem & Motivation

Power systems today do not have any standardized framework for using LLMs.
All existing grid tools are numerical and engineering-focused, while LLMs require structured, interpretable text to reason effectively.

Unlike healthcare (which has FHIR + MedPrompt), the power domain lacks:

Prompt templates

Structured-to-text converters

RAG-based retrieval for grid logs

LLM-friendly interpretation pipelines

This means the industry cannot use LLMs reliably for loadflow interpretation, fault diagnosis, or SCADA anomaly reasoning.

Our goal:
Create the first domain-adaptive LLM prompt engineering framework for power systems.

💬 Discord Message 2 — Introducing PowerPrompt

We propose PowerPrompt, the first prompt-builder architecture designed specifically for power grids.
It is inspired by MedPrompt, but adapted to engineering workflows.

PowerPrompt includes:

PowerGrid2Text → Converts structured grid data into clear natural language

Embedding + Vector Database → Stores historical grid faults & SCADA events

Domain-specific prompt templates → Voltage analysis, overload detection, loadflow explanation

LLM decision support agent → Answers grid operator questions

This framework makes LLMs actually usable for operational grid reasoning.

💬 Discord Message 3 — Dataset & Experiments

For testing the framework, we use the IEEE 14-Bus system, plus synthetic SCADA measurements and synthetic fault logs.

We evaluate three core functionalities:

1️⃣ PowerGrid2Text Accuracy & Clarity
Converts numerical grid snapshots into LLM-ready descriptive text.

2️⃣ RAG Fault Retrieval
Retrieves similar past faults from a vector database (Chroma/Redis) using embeddings.

3️⃣ LLM-Based Loadflow Interpretation
LLM interprets voltage violations, overloads, low frequencies, etc., based on the structured-text representation.

These tests demonstrate whether LLMs can reason meaningfully about grid conditions.

💬 Discord Message 4 — Key Results

🚀 Result 1 — A Working PowerGrid2Text Module
Grid data is transformed into consistent natural language, improving interpretability.

🚀 Result 2 — Better LLM Reasoning
LLMs make more accurate engineering observations when fed structured text (vs raw numbers).
They correctly identify weak buses, overloaded lines, and abnormal SCADA states.

🚀 Result 3 — Functional RAG Fault Diagnosis
LLMs retrieve relevant historical fault patterns, producing clearer explanations and more reliable diagnoses.

Overall:
Structured template + text conversion + RAG dramatically improves LLM performance in power engineering tasks.

💬 Discord Message 5 — Final Conclusions

PowerPrompt introduces a completely new way to use LLMs for power system operations.

Our conclusions:

We introduce the first standardized LLM prompt framework for power systems.

We develop PowerGrid2Text, similar to FHIR2Text but for engineering data.

We demonstrate that LLMs reason better with structured, domain-specific text.

RAG enables reliable retrieval of historical grid faults for improved diagnosis.

The system is modular and can work with SCADA, CIM, loadflow models, and operator logs.

This work shows that LLMs can support real grid decision-making if the right prompt-engineering framework is applied.
